Creating Accounts
-----------------

We have implemented creating accounts where the user is allowed to create an account and view their profile through progression throughout the quiz game

To log into an existing account we used the following code
`If the user name or passowrd is incorrect then we have a promise that resolves to true, false otherwise.`

.. code::

   *Logs in a user with the provided username and password
   @param {string} username - The username of the account.
   @param {string} password - The password of the account
   @returns {Promise<boolean>} - A promise that resolves to true if the login is successful, false otherwise



now where were we at
